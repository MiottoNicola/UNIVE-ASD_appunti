# ASD Notes
Personal notes taken during the lessons of the Data Structures and Algorithms course - CT0371, held by professors Marcello Pelillo and Alessandra Raffaet√†.

Despite the fact that these notes have been taken with the utmost attention and without skipping a single lesson, I do not guarantee the absence of errors of any kind, and I warmly invite anyone who has to take the exam to follow the professors' lessons head-on, as this document is not meant to replace them.
